        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style based on objects that combine data and functions. It uses key principles like:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Class: Template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Object: Instance of a class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Encapsulation: Hides internal details.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Inheritance: Reuses code from other classes.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Polymorphism: Allows different behaviors with the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It holds actual data and can perform actions defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "    . Abstraction = Hiding what is done.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Encapsulation hides internal details by bundling data and methods together.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Encapsulation = Hiding how it is done.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) in Python are special methods with names like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> They let you define how objects behave with built-in operations, like:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . __init__: Constructor (obj = MyClass())\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . __str__: String representation (print(obj))\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . __add__: Defines + behavior (obj1 + obj2)\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> They’re also called magic methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Inheritance in OOP allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Promotes code reuse\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> Enables hierarchical relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism in OOP means one interface, many implementations.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> It allows different classes to use the same method name but behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Encapsulation in Python is achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Classes: To bundle data and methods.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Access modifiers (by naming convention):\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . public: Accessible anywhere (e.g., name)\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . _protected: Meant for internal use (e.g., _name)\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . __private: Name mangled to restrict access (e.g., __name)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> It initializes an object when it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> n Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class Method\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Defined with @classmethod\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Takes cls as the first argument\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Can access/modify class-level data\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Static Method\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Defined with @staticmethod\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Takes no self or cls\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Acts like a regular function, but inside the class\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Python doesn't support true method overloading.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . You can mimic it using default arguments or *args/**kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method overriding in OOP means a child class redefines a method from its parent class with the same name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Purpose:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . To provide a specific implementation in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The @property decorator in Python lets you define a method as a read-only attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . To access a method like an attribute\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Useful for getter functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism is important in OOP because it:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Simplifies code by using a common interface\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ->Enhances flexibility and scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Supports code reuse and clean design\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> It can define abstract methods (methods with no implementation).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Use the abc module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Modularity – Code is organized into classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Reusability – Inheritance allows reuse of existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Maintainability – Easier to update and fix code.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  -> Class Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Shared by all objects of the class\n",
        "  \n",

        "\n",
        "  -> Instance Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Unique to each object\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Defined using self inside methods\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Combines features from multiple classes\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Python uses MRO (Method Resolution Order) to decide which method runs if there's a conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> __str__\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For readable display (used by print())\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Meant for end users\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> __repr__\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - For unambiguous representation (used in debugging, or repr())\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Meant for developers\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Allows access to inherited methods\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> Helps in method overriding\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> Supports multiple inheritance correctly via MRO\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Used to clean up resources (like files or connections).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> @staticmethod\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - First parameter\t- None\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to override methods from a parent class, and you can call these methods using a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> A base class defines a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Subclasses override that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> You can call the method on objects of different subclasses, and each will behave differently\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method chaining in Python OOP is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Each method returns self, so the next method can be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> To make an object behave like a function\n",
